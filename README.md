# Gem-Prediction-Bot
# Overview
Here's a high-level overview of how the gem prediction bot program could work:
Image Acquisition: The program captures screenshots of the game board whenever the user clicks on a tile or cashes out. The screenshots are saved to a designated folder for further processing.
Image Preprocessing: The program preprocesses the images by resizing them to a consistent size and normalizing the pixel values. This ensures that the images are in a consistent format that can be fed into the deep learning model.
Data Augmentation: The program applies data augmentation techniques to the preprocessed images to increase the size of the training dataset. This can include techniques such as rotation, flipping, and cropping.
Model Training: The program uses the preprocessed and augmented images to train a deep learning model. The model can be based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that is commonly used for image classification tasks.
Model Evaluation: The program evaluates the performance of the deep learning model using a test dataset. The program can use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess the performance of the model.
Prediction: Once the model is trained, the program can use it to predict the location of mines and gems on the game board. The program can use the predicted probabilities to guide the user's decisions and help them maximize their winnings.
Here's a more detailed diagram of the system architecture:

# Requirements
Python 3.11 or higher
Numpy
OpenCV
Pillow
Tensorflow
MSS
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
Itertools
Installation
Install Python 3.11 or higher from the official website.
Install the required dependencies by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Usage
Run the run.sh or run.bat script to execute all the scripts in order:
./run.sh
run.bat
The program will capture images of the game board, preprocess and augment the images, train a deep learning model, and evaluate the model.
The program will save the captured images, preprocessed images, augmented images, trained model, and evaluation results in separate directories.
